OVERVIEW 

This package contains the program regevscape which simulations the evolution
of regulatory DNA for a single enhancer or promoter. Please see the original
paper for details on the purposes and interpretation of this program:

   Changes in Selective Effects Over Time Facilitate Turnover of 
   Enhancer Sequences. Bullaughey KL, Genetics. 2010 Nov 23. 
   [Epub ahead of print]

Please contact me (kbullaughey@gmail.com) if you have questions about this 
software or the paper.

INSTALLATION

To compile regevscape in the simplest setting, you can do the following:

   ./configure
   make

Installing it will copy the main binary to the bin directory contained in the 
distribution, accomplished as follows:

   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This program requires the GNU Scientific Library, gsl. If you have this in
a non-standard location, you can specify where to find the include and lib
directories when you run configure:

   ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib" CFLAGS="-I/sw/include"

Replace /sw/lib and /sw/include with wherever gsl.h and libgsl (and possibly
libgslcblas) are located.

OpenMP

If OpenMP is available on your system (and detected by configure) then OpenMP
support will be compiled in. However, currently the only aspect of the code
that is parallelized is the partially implemented inference model. So in the
current version, whether you have openmp should make no difference.

Enjoy.
