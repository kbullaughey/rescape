	Abstract = {The establishment of complex expression patterns at precise times and locations is key to metazoan development, yet a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transcription control networks is still missing. Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

	Abstract = {Correct gene expression is often critical and consequently stabilizing selection on expression is widespread. Yet few genes possess highly conserved regulatory DNA, and for the few enhancers that have been carefully characterized, substantial functional reorganization has often occurred. Given that natural selection removes mutations of even very small deleterious effect, how can transcription factor binding evolve so readily when it underlies a conserved phenotype? As a first step towards addressing this question, I combine a computational model for regulatory function that incorporates many aspects of our present biological knowledge with a model for the fitness effects of misexpression. I then use this model to study the evolution of enhancers. Several robust behaviors emerge: First, the selective effects of mutations at a site change dramatically over time due to substitutions elsewhere in the enhancer, and even the overall degree of constraint across the enhancer can change considerably. Second, many of the substitutions responsible for changes in binding occur at sites where previously the mutation would have been strongly deleterious, suggesting that fluctuations in selective effects at a site are important for functional turnover. Third, most substitutions contributing to the repatterning of binding and constraint are effectively neutral, highlighting the importance of genetic drift---even for enhancers underlying conserved phenotypes. These findings have important implications for phylogenetic inference of function and for interpretations of selection coefficients estimated for regulatory DNA.
